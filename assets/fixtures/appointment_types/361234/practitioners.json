      "description": "Nicole is a specialist sports physiotherapist and has a wide experience working with elite athletes ( including England Women Rugby Players) and amateur athletes. She has a special interest in the shoulder and has helped many runners manage injuries before competitions. Her own experience in sport has taught her the resilience needed and psychological impact of being out of training. This gives her the edge in helping you get back on track and expert knowledge to ensure you get the right advice and treatment. People experiencing non sporting injuries can benefit from her systematic approach without the delay of waiting for NHS treatment.",
